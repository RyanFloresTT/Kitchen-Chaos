# Kitchen-Chaos
This game project was developed by following a tutorial from the popular YouTube channel "Code Monkey". The creator of the channel, Code Monkey, is a well-respected and knowledgeable instructor in the Unity game development community, known for his comprehensive and informative tutorials on the platform. This project provided the opportunity to learn about Unity Events, as well as deepen understanding of C# concepts like interfaces and Unity-specific Scriptable Objects.

I decided to include this tutorial-followed project on my portfolio because it showcases the valuable skills and knowledge I gained from the experience. Although I did not build the project from scratch, completing it was a challenging and educational experience that allowed me to further understand and apply concepts such as Unity Events, C# interfaces, and Unity Scriptable Objects.
